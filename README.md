**What git hub does:**

* You save normal files (.doc, .csv, .txt) to the local drive (file explorer)
* Make edits to those on the normal interface

 	- GitHub tracks these changes in the repository and will show you those changes

* When you want to commit and save these changes as like "official" changes/versions that you want to track

 	- Commit these to the repository with a bit of a summary to the update

 	- All these little changes won't be committed (like the typing, deleting etc)

 	- But the difference between the previous commit and the most recent commit will get saved



**What makes a good commit**

* Atomic and orthogonal

 	- does one whole thing

 	- one thing at a time - makes it easier to undo one thing at a time

* E.g.

 	- One whole new feature

 	- one bug fix



**Publishing to repository**

* Publish to repository and this is like a back-up
* Saves to the repository and is good for collaboration



**Cloning from repository**

* Then can clone from repository
* e.g. if you delete or lose laptop
* Can clone the repository from git back to the local drive



**Reverting a publish**

* If you commit and publish a commit
* And the right-click and revert commit, it will go back to the previous version and you can decide to publish this
* But this will undo any changes you have made



**How GitHub workflow works**

* Work on the thing locally in your files
* Save it in your files

 	- GitHub tracks these changes

 	- Can undo on the file itself

* Committing sends it to repository limbo

 	- Getting ready to send it to the online repository

 	- Can undo by "undo commit" so this won't get pushed

* Pushing sends it to online repository

 	- Uploaded to the repository and backed up

 	- Can undo by reverting

 	- This will revert back to what it was before the push

 	- Takes it back to repository limbo

 	- If you want this version, you can push this and it will go back to the version before

 	- If you don't want this, you can undo the commit and it will undo the revert



**Undo revert**
