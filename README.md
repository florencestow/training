git hub training



To do at the training

\[] New file

\[] What GitHub does 

\[] What makes a good commit 





**What git hub does:** 

* You save normal files (.doc, .csv, .txt) to the local drive (file explorer) 
* Make edits to those on the normal interface 

&nbsp;	- GitHub tracks these changes in the repository and will show you those changes 

* When you want to commit and save these changes as like "official" changes/versions that you want to track

&nbsp;	- Commit these to the repository with a bit of a summary to the update 

&nbsp;	- All these little changes won't be committed (like the typing, deleting etc) 

&nbsp;	- But the difference between the previous commit and the most recent commit will get saved  



**What makes a good commit**

* Atomic and orthogonal 

&nbsp;	- does one whole thing

&nbsp;	- one thing at a time - makes it easier to undo one thing at a time 

* E.g. 

&nbsp;	- One whole new feature 

&nbsp;	- one bug fix
