**What git hub does:**

* You save normal files (.doc, .csv, .txt) to the local drive (file explorer)
* Make edits to those on the normal interface

 	- GitHub tracks these changes in the repository and will show you those changes

* When you want to commit and save these changes as like "official" changes/versions that you want to track

 	- Commit these to the repository with a bit of a summary to the update

 	- All these little changes won't be committed (like the typing, deleting etc)

 	- But the difference between the previous commit and the most recent commit will get saved



**What makes a good commit**

* Atomic and orthogonal

 	- does one whole thing

 	- one thing at a time - makes it easier to undo one thing at a time

* E.g.

 	- One whole new feature

 	- one bug fix



**Publishing to repository**

* Publish to repository and this is like a back-up 
* Saves to the repository and is good for collaboration 



**Cloning from repository**

* Then can clone from repository 
* e.g. if you delete or lose laptop 
* Can clone the repository from git back to the local drive
